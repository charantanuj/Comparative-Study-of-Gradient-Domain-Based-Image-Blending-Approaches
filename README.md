# Comparative-Study-of-Gradient-Domain-Based-Image-Blending-Approaches
- The paper describes a comparative study of three different approaches that are used for image blending. The main focus will remain on the approaches where single source image and target is composed in the gradient domain. The main aim of the study is to portray the importance of considering gradients in image blending
